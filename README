Code and Files for the article "Demogenomic inference from spatially and temporally heterogeneous samples", Marchi, Kapopoulou, and Excoffier

##CODES##
The zipped directories linux.zip and win.zip contain the fastsimcoal linux and windows versions used for the analyses

##SIMULATION##
Simulated data for models with spatial or temporal heterogeneities and attempts to recover these true scenarios with fastsimcoal

###SIMULATED DATA###
10 replicated sfs have been simulated under conditions described in Table 1 (named def by fastsimcoal) for 3 models: 

1) "Spatial2pop" = Spatial heterogeneity with 2 populations per continent (Fig 1A) 
	- Def 1: Strong heterogeneity; No admixture
	- Def 2: Weak heterogeneity; No admixture
	- Def 3: No heterogeneity; No admixture
	- Def 4: Medium heterogeneity; Large admixture
	- Def 5: Medium heterogeneity; Small admixture
	- Def 6: Medium heterogeneity; No admixture

2) "10PopDivPool" = Spatial heterogeneity with 5 populations per continent (Fig 1B)
	- Def 3: no admixture for n=2 
	- Def 6: no admixture for n=10 

3) "Temporal" = Temporal Heterogeneity
	- Def 1: 2 populations per continent (Fig 1C)
	- Def 5: 1 population per continent (Fig 1D)

###ESTIMATES###
Attempt to recover true (=simulated) parameters with different strategies described in Fig 2
	- "noStruct" = No Structure
	- "fis" = Implicit Structure
	- "pool" = Explicit Structure
	- "onepop" = Temporal Structure

Likelihoods of the different tested strategies are shown in Lhood_xxx.txt in each model folder
Parameters estimated for the different tested strategies are shown in Param_xxx.txt in each model folder

##SGDP##
Fastsimcoal input files for the 4 scenarios tested on the SGDP data
